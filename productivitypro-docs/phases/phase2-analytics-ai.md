     - Calendar integration (Google Calendar, Outlook).
     - Ability to accept/reject/modify suggestions.
     - Learning from user feedback to improve future suggestions.

4. **As a user**, I want to see my focus score and trends so I can track my improvement over time.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - Daily focus score (0-100) based on productive time and distractions.
     - Focus trend chart (daily, weekly, monthly).
     - Comparison with previous periods.
     - Factors affecting the score with suggestions for improvement.
