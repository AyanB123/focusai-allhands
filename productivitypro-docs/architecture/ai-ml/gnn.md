# Graph Neural Network (GNN) Architecture

## Overview

The Graph Neural Network (GNN) is a key component of ProductivityPro's advanced AI capabilities, specifically designed to analyze workflow patterns and identify productivity insights. The GNN processes user activity data as a graph, where nodes represent applications or websites, and edges represent transitions between them.

## Purpose

The GNN serves several critical functions within ProductivityPro:

1. **Workflow Analysis**: Identify patterns in how users transition between applications and websites
2. **Distraction Detection**: Highlight transitions that lead to productivity drops
3. **Optimization Suggestions**: Generate personalized recommendations to improve workflow
4. **Relationship Visualization**: Power the interactive workflow graph in the UI

## Architecture

### Graph Structure

- **Nodes**: Applications and websites (e.g., "VS Code", "Slack", "Gmail")
- **Node Features**: 
  - Application category
  - Average time spent
  - Productivity score (user-defined or learned)
  - Time of day distribution
- **Edges**: Transitions between applications
- **Edge Features**:
  - Transition frequency
  - Average transition duration
  - Time of day distribution
  - Productivity impact score

### Model Architecture

The GNN implementation uses a combination of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT):

1. **Input Layer**: Takes the graph structure and node/edge features
2. **Graph Convolutional Layers**:
   - 3 GCN layers with 128, 64, and 32 hidden units
   - ReLU activation functions
   - Batch normalization between layers
3. **Graph Attention Layer**:
   - 2 attention heads
   - Learns which transitions are most important
4. **Output Layers**:
   - Node classification: Predicts productivity impact of each application
   - Edge classification: Identifies distracting transitions
   - Graph-level output: Overall workflow efficiency score

### Implementation Details

```python
class ProductivityGNN(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_node_features, num_edge_features, hidden_channels):
        super(ProductivityGNN, self).__init__()
        
        # Graph Convolutional Layers
        self.conv1 = GCNConv(num_node_features, hidden_channels)
        self.bn1 = torch.nn.BatchNorm1d(hidden_channels)
        self.conv2 = GCNConv(hidden_channels, hidden_channels // 2)
        self.bn2 = torch.nn.BatchNorm1d(hidden_channels // 2)
        self.conv3 = GCNConv(hidden_channels // 2, hidden_channels // 4)
        
        # Graph Attention Layer
        self.gat = GATConv(hidden_channels // 4, hidden_channels // 4, heads=2)
        
        # Output layers
        self.node_classifier = torch.nn.Linear(hidden_channels // 4, 1)
        self.edge_classifier = torch.nn.Linear(hidden_channels // 2, 1)
        self.graph_classifier = torch.nn.Linear(hidden_channels // 4, 1)
        
    def forward(self, x, edge_index, edge_attr, batch):
        # Node embedding via GCN
        x = self.conv1(x, edge_index)
        x = self.bn1(x)
        x = F.relu(x)
        x = F.dropout(x, p=0.2, training=self.training)
        
        x = self.conv2(x, edge_index)
        x = self.bn2(x)
        x = F.relu(x)
        x = F.dropout(x, p=0.2, training=self.training)
        
        x = self.conv3(x, edge_index)
        x = F.relu(x)
        
        # Attention mechanism
        x = self.gat(x, edge_index)
        
        # Node-level predictions
        node_pred = self.node_classifier(x)
        
        # Edge-level predictions
        edge_features = torch.cat([x[edge_index[0]], x[edge_index[1]]], dim=1)
        edge_pred = self.edge_classifier(edge_features)
        
        # Graph-level prediction
        graph_embedding = global_mean_pool(x, batch)
        graph_pred = self.graph_classifier(graph_embedding)
        
        return node_pred, edge_pred, graph_pred
```

## Training Process

The GNN is trained using a multi-task learning approach:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - User activity logs with timestamps and durations
   - User-provided productivity ratings for applications
   - Transition data between applications

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Convert activity logs to graph structure
   - Normalize features
   - Apply time-based windowing (daily, weekly)

3. **Training Objectives**:
   - Node classification: Mean squared error for productivity impact
   - Edge classification: Binary cross-entropy for distraction detection
   - Graph-level: Mean squared error for workflow efficiency

4. **Training Strategy**:
   - Initial training on anonymized user data
   - Fine-tuning on individual user data
   - Continuous learning with new user data (opt-in)

5. **Hyperparameters**:
   - Learning rate: 0.001
   - Batch size: 32
   - Epochs: 100
   - Early stopping patience: 10

## Integration with Other Components

The GNN interacts with several other components of ProductivityPro:

1. **Activity Tracker**: Provides raw activity data for graph construction
2. **Transformer Model**: Combines GNN insights with natural language for chat responses
3. **CNN Model**: Shares pattern detection with GNN for comprehensive analysis
4. **GAN Model**: Uses GNN predictions to simulate workflow changes
5. **Frontend Workflow View**: Visualizes the graph structure and insights

## Performance Considerations

To ensure optimal performance on desktop hardware:

1. **Model Optimization**:
   - Quantization to reduce model size
   - Pruning to remove unnecessary connections
   - Batch processing for inference

2. **Inference Efficiency**:
   - Graph caching for frequently accessed patterns
   - Incremental updates instead of full recomputation
   - Background processing during idle time

3. **Metrics**:
   - Inference time: <500ms on standard hardware
   - Model size: <50MB
   - Memory usage: <200MB during inference

## Privacy and Security

The GNN implementation includes several privacy-preserving features:

1. **Local Processing**: All graph analysis happens on the user's device
2. **Anonymization**: Any shared data for training is anonymized
3. **Differential Privacy**: Added noise to protect sensitive patterns
4. **Opt-in Training**: Users control whether their data improves the model

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements for the GNN component:

1. **Temporal GNN**: Incorporate time-based graph evolution
2. **Hierarchical GNN**: Group applications into higher-level workflows
3. **Cross-device GNN**: Analyze patterns across multiple devices
4. **Explainable GNN**: Provide clearer reasoning for suggestions
