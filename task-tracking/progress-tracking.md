## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Activity tracking performance issues | High | Medium | Optimize tracking code, implement batching |
| AI model accuracy below expectations | Medium | Medium | Increase training data, refine model architecture |
| Integration challenges with browser extensions | Medium | High | Start browser extension development early |
| Cross-platform compatibility issues | High | Medium | Comprehensive testing on all platforms |
| Scope creep in AI features | Medium | High | Clearly define MVP features, use phased approach |
