# AI/ML Tasks - Phase 1: Core Tracking and Categorization

This file tracks AI/ML tasks for Phase 1 of the ProductivityPro project. Note that Phase 1 has minimal AI/ML components, as the focus is on core tracking functionality. More advanced AI/ML tasks will be added in Phases 2 and 3.

## Detailed Tasks

### A1.1: Set up Python environment for ML pipeline

**Description:** Configure the Python environment and dependencies for the ML pipeline.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Python 3.9+ environment with virtual environment
- Required libraries installed (TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, etc.)
- Development environment configured (linting, testing)
- Documentation for setup process

**Steps:**
1. Create virtual environment setup script
2. Define requirements.txt with necessary dependencies
3. Set up linting and testing framework
4. Document setup process for developers

**Notes:**
- 

### A1.2: Create basic activity classification model

**Description:** Develop a simple ML model to classify activities into categories.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Model classifies activities with >80% accuracy
- Handles common apps and websites
- Fast inference (<100ms per classification)
- Can be trained on limited data (100+ samples)

**Steps:**
1. Create dataset from sample activity logs
2. Develop feature extraction for app names and URLs
3. Train simple classifier (Random Forest or SVM)
4. Implement serialization for model storage

**Notes:**
- 

### A1.3: Implement Python-Node.js bridge

**Description:** Create a communication bridge between Node.js backend and Python ML code.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Reliable communication between Node.js and Python
- Handles data serialization/deserialization
- Error handling and recovery
- Low latency (<200ms round trip)

**Steps:**
1. Evaluate options (child_process, python-shell, ZeroMQ)
2. Implement chosen solution with proper error handling
3. Create data serialization/deserialization utilities
4. Add logging and monitoring
