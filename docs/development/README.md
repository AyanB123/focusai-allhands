- QA engineers
- DevOps engineers
- Technical documentation writers
- Open source contributors

## Development Philosophy

ProductivityPro follows these development principles:

1. **Code Quality**: Prioritize clean, maintainable code over quick fixes
2. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementing features
3. **Documentation-First**: Document design decisions and APIs before implementation
4. **Continuous Integration**: Automate testing and deployment processes
5. **Iterative Development**: Build features incrementally with regular feedback
