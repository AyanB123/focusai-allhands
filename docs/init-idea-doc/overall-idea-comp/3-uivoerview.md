### UI Overview: ProductivityPro

#### Design Philosophy
ProductivityPro’s UI is designed to be **minimalist**, **functional**, and **engaging**, drawing inspiration from Rize.io’s sleek, data-driven aesthetic. The app uses a dark/light theme toggle (default: dark mode for reduced eye strain), with a focus on clear typography, vibrant data visualizations, and subtle animations to enhance usability. The interface prioritizes **at-a-glance insights** and **interactive elements**, ensuring users can quickly access productivity metrics, AI suggestions, and settings without feeling overwhelmed. Tailwind CSS ensures a responsive, modern look, while React enables dynamic, component-based rendering.

- **Color Scheme**: Dark mode (black #1A1A1A, gray #2D2D2D, white accents #FFFFFF) with light mode option (white #F5F5F5, gray #E0E0E0). Accent colors (blue #3B82F6, green #10B981) highlight interactive elements.
- **Typography**: Inter font (clean, sans-serif) for readability, with sizes ranging from 12px (labels) to 24px (headings).
- **Animations**: Subtle transitions (e.g., 0.3s ease-in-out for hover states) and micro-interactions (e.g., button clicks, modal pop-ups) for a polished feel.
- **Layout**: Sidebar navigation (collapsible), top bar for system controls, and a main content area with modular widgets.

#### App Structure
The app is organized into **five primary screens**, each with distinct states and components, accessible via a **sidebar navigation**. A **system tray icon** provides quick access to core functions (e.g., pause tracking, open chat widget). The screens are:
1. **Dashboard**: Overview of productivity metrics and activity insights.
2. **Analytics**: Detailed reports and visualizations.
3. **Scheduler**: Predictive task planning and calendar integration.
4. **Workflow**: Relationship mapping and pattern insights.
5. **Settings**: Configuration for tracking, integrations, and UI preferences.

A **floating chat widget** and **focus mode** overlay provide additional functionality across all screens.
