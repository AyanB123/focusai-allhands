ProductivityPro UI Specification
This document provides a comprehensive description of the ProductivityPro user interface, focusing on visual components, screens, AI-driven features (powered by Transformer, GNN, LSTM, CNN, GAN), graphs, interactions, and user flow. It ensures a cohesive, intuitive, and visually appealing experience, with support for internationalization (i18n) in English, Spanish, and Mandarin, and accessibility (a11y) per WCAG 2.1 AA. The UI is built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Electron, using Chart.js, Plotly, and D3.js for visualizations, and framer-motion for animations.
