# ProductivityPro Requirement Documents

## 1. Overview
**ProductivityPro** is a cross-platform desktop productivity application that enhances time tracking, activity analysis, and work optimization with advanced AI capabilities. It builds on Rize.io’s core features (automatic time tracking, categorization, analytics) and adds AI-driven predictive scheduling, workflow insights, a context-aware chat assistant, and scenario simulation. The app is built with Electron and Node.js for the frontend and backend, and Python for AI/ML processing, using five neural networks: Transformer, Graph Neural Network (GNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).

These documents outline the development requirements across **four phases**, each with user requirements, detailed tasks, and component breakdowns. The structure supports Kanban board workflows (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done) and git branching strategies (e.g., `feature/phase1-tracking`, `feature/phase2-ai`). Tasks are categorized by component (Frontend, Backend, AI/ML, Integrations, DevOps) to facilitate team assignments and modular development.

To manage tasks, set up a Kanban board (e.g., Trello, Jira) with the following structure:
- **Columns**:
  - To Do: New tasks (e.g., T1.1, T2.3).
  - In Progress: Assigned tasks with active development.
  - Review: Tasks in pull request or QA.
  - Done: Completed and merged tasks.
- **Labels**:
  - Frontend (blue), Backend (green), AI/ML (purple), DevOps (yellow).
  - Priority: High (red), Medium (orange), Low (gray).
  - Phase: Phase 1 (P1), Phase 2 (P2), Phase 3 (P3), Phase 4 (P4).
- **Cards**:
  - Title: Task ID and name (e.g., “T1.2: Build Dashboard Timeline”).
  - Description: Task details, acceptance criteria, dependencies.
  - Assignee: Developer name or team (e.g., Frontend Team).
  - Estimate: Effort in hours (e.g., 16h).
  - Branch: Associated git branch (e.g., `feature/t1.2-dashboard-timeline`).

## 6. Git Workflow
- **Repository**: `github.com/productivitypro/productivitypro`.
- **Branch Structure**:
  - `main`: Production-ready code.
  - `develop`: Integration branch for features.
  - `feature/*`: Per-task branches (e.g., `feature/t1.2-dashboard-timeline`).
  - `bugfix/*`: Bug fixes (e.g., `bugfix/activity-tracker-idle`).
  - `release/*`: Pre-release builds (e.g., `release/v1.0`).
- **Commit Messages**:
  - Format: `[Task ID] Description` (e.g., “[T1.2] Add activity timeline widget”).
  - Include context (e.g., “Fixes idle detection bug”).
- **Pull Requests**:
  - Require 2 approvals, automated tests passing.
  - Link to Kanban card for traceability.
- **Merge Strategy**:
  - Squash and merge to `develop` for clean history.
  - Rebase `main` for releases.

## 7. Resource and Funding Estimates
- **Team**:
  - 4 developers (2 frontend, 2 backend): Phases 1–3.
  - 3 AI engineers: Phases 2–4.
  - 1 DevOps engineer: All phases.
  - 1 QA engineer: Phase 4.
  - Cost: ~$250,000/year (assuming $50,000/developer).
- **Infrastructure**:
  - AWS: $10,000–$30,000/year (SageMaker, S3, DynamoDB).
  - CI/CD: $5,000/year (GitHub Actions, monitoring tools).
- **Funding**:
  - Freemium: Free tracking, $9.99/month for AI features.
  - One-Time Purchase: $99 lifetime access.
  - Estimated Revenue: $1.2M/year with 10,000 premium users.
- **Timeline**:
  - Total: 12 months (3 + 3 + 4 + 2).
  - Milestones: MVP (Phase 1), Beta (Phase 3), Release (Phase 4).

## 8. Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk**: AI model training delays due to data scarcity.
  - **Mitigation**: Use synthetic datasets, prioritize pretraining.
- **Risk**: Performance issues with local AI inference.
  - **Mitigation**: Quantize models, optimize with mixed precision.
- **Risk**: Browser extension compatibility issues.
  - **Mitigation**: Test on Chrome/Firefox nightly builds, fallback to app-only tracking.
- **Risk**: User privacy concerns.
  - **Mitigation**: Transparent opt-outs, local-first storage, GDPR compliance.
- **Risk**: Scope creep with integrations.
  - **Mitigation**: Limit to Google Calendar, Outlook, Trello; defer others to post-release.

## 9. Documentation and Support
- **Developer Docs**:
  - Setup: Node.js, Electron, Python, AWS.
  - API: OpenAPI spec for REST/WebSocket.
  - AI: Model training, inference, and endpoints.
  - Hosted: `productivitypro.app/docs/developer`.
- **User Docs**:
  - Setup guide: Install app, configure tracking, connect integrations.
  - Tutorials: Use dashboard, scheduler, chat, focus mode.
  - FAQs: Privacy, troubleshooting, support contacts.
  - Hosted: `productivitypro.app/docs`.
- **Support**:
  - Email: `support@productivitypro.app`.
  - In-app: Chat widget with FAQs and ticket submission.

## 10. Conclusion
These requirement documents provide a detailed roadmap for developing **ProductivityPro**, covering all user requirements across four phases: core tracking, analytics/AI, advanced AI/workflow, and polish/release. Tasks are broken down into actionable steps with clear acceptance criteria, categorized by component (Frontend, Backend, AI/ML, DevOps) for Kanban boards and git branches. The modular design supports team collaboration, with dependencies and estimates ensuring efficient progress tracking. By leveraging Electron, Node.js, and Python, and integrating five neural networks, ProductivityPro delivers a modern, AI-driven productivity tool that surpasses Rize.io’s capabilities, ready for implementation by an engineering team.
