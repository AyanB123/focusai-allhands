- **Dependencies**:
  - Electron (v20.x) for the desktop app.
  - Node.js (v18.x) for backend services.
  - Python (3.9+) for AI/ML processing, with pip for libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face).
  - SQLite for local storage, with optional AWS CLI for cloud setup.
- **Steps**:
  1. Install the app via a setup wizard (MSI for Windows, DMG for macOS, AppImage for Linux).
  2. Grant permissions for screen capture and accessibility to track active windows.
  3. Install browser extensions (Chrome, Firefox) for URL tracking.
  4. Create a user account for personalized settings and optional cloud syncing.

### 4.2 Configuration
- **User Settings**:
  - Configure tracking preferences (e.g., weekdays only, specific apps to ignore).
  - Set up categories and project tags in the settings panel.
  - Connect Google Calendar/Outlook via OAuth for integration.
- **AI/ML Setup**:
  - Initialize pre-trained models (downloaded during installation) for local inference.
  - Optional: Connect to AWS for cloud-based model training (requires user opt-in).
- **Browser Extensions**:
  - Install extensions from Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons.
  - Configure URL tracking settings (e.g., exclude private browsing).

### 4.3 Initialization
- **Local Database**: SQLite database created on first run, storing activity logs and user settings.
- **Model Deployment**: Pre-trained models (DistilBERT, GNN, LSTM, CNN, GAN) loaded into the AI/ML pipeline.
- **Background Services**: Node.js server runs locally (port 3000) for API/WebSocket communication, with Python scripts for AI processing.

## 5. Storage Strategy
ProductivityPro prioritizes local storage for privacy, with optional cloud syncing for advanced users. Here’s how data is managed:

### 5.1 Local Storage
- **Database**: SQLite, stored in the user’s app data directory (e.g., `~/.productivitypro`).
- **Data Types**:
  - **Activity Logs**: JSON objects with app/window titles, URLs, timestamps, and durations.
  - **User Settings**: Categories, project tags, integration tokens, and preferences.
  - **Model Outputs**: Predictions, analytics, and chat responses (encrypted).
- **Encryption**: AES-256 encryption for sensitive data (e.g., URLs, chat history).
- **Optimization**: Indexed tables for fast queries, with periodic cleanup of old logs (user-configurable).

### 5.2 Cache
- **Purpose**: Speeds up frequent queries (e.g., chat responses, predictions).
- **Technology**: Redis (local instance) for caching model outputs and dashboard data.
- **Retention**: Cache expires after 24 hours or user-defined periods to manage disk space.

### 5.3 Optional Cloud Storage
- **Purpose**: Enables backups and cross-device syncing (e.g., for users with multiple computers).
- **Technology**: AWS S3 for file storage, DynamoDB for structured data.
- **Security**: Encrypted data transfer (TLS) and storage (AES-256), with user-controlled access via AWS IAM.
- **Opt-In**: Users must explicitly enable cloud syncing in settings, with clear privacy disclosures.

### 5.4 Data Flow
- **Collection**: Activity Tracker captures raw data and sends it to the backend.
- **Processing**: Backend formats data and stores it in SQLite, with copies sent to the AI/ML pipeline.
- **Output Storage**: AI outputs (e.g., predictions, analytics) stored in SQLite and cached in Redis.
- **Syncing**: Cloud storage syncs periodically (user-configured) via AWS SDK.
