# Detailed Backend and Processing Document: ProductivityPro

## 1. Overview
**ProductivityPro** is a cross-platform desktop productivity application designed to enhance time tracking, activity analysis, and work optimization through advanced AI capabilities. Built with Electron and Node.js for the frontend and backend, and Python for AI/ML processing, the app integrates five neural network architectures—Transformer, Graph Neural Network (GNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)—to deliver predictive scheduling, deep workflow insights, and a context-aware chat assistant.

This document details the backend architecture, focusing on data collection, processing, and API management, and provides an in-depth design of the neural network systems, including their training, data structures, and integration with the backend. It ensures a privacy-focused, scalable, and efficient system, with clear specifications for developers to implement the backend and AI pipeline.

## 2. Backend Architecture
The backend is a Node.js-based system running locally on the user’s device, integrated with Electron for desktop functionality and Python for AI/ML processing. It handles activity tracking, data processing, API services, and external integrations, serving as the bridge between the frontend and AI pipeline. The architecture is modular, with components designed for scalability, low latency, and privacy.

### 2.1 Architectural Components
- **Activity Tracker**:
  - **Purpose**: Captures real-time data on active windows, applications, and browser URLs.
  - **Implementation**: Uses Electron’s `desktopCapturer` API and browser extensions (Chrome, Firefox) via WebExtensions API.
  - **Data Output**: JSON objects (e.g., `{ "timestamp": "2025-05-23T17:00:00", "app": "VS Code", "url": null, "title": "main.js", "duration": 60 }`).
  - **Features**: Idle detection (no input for 5+ minutes), configurable tracking intervals (default: 1s).
- **Event Processor**:
  - **Purpose**: Aggregates and preprocesses raw activity data for storage and AI processing.
  - **Implementation**: Node.js with `async` queues for batch processing.
  - **Functions**:
    - Deduplicates overlapping events (e.g., multiple Chrome tabs).
    - Normalizes data (e.g., standardizes app names, extracts domains from URLs).
    - Assigns initial categories using rule-based logic (e.g., “YouTube” → “Entertainment”).
- **API Server**:
  - **Purpose**: Exposes REST and WebSocket endpoints for frontend and AI interactions.
  - **Implementation**: Express.js for REST, `ws` library for WebSocket.
  - **Endpoints**:
    - `GET /api/activities`: Fetch activity logs (filtered by date, category, project).
    - `POST /api/activities/categorize`: Update activity categories.
    - `WS /ws/realtime`: Stream real-time activity updates and AI suggestions.
    - `POST /api/ai/chat`: Send chat queries to the Transformer model.
  - **Security**: JWT-based authentication for user sessions, rate limiting (100 requests/min).
- **Integration Manager**:
  - **Purpose**: Syncs with external services (Google Calendar, Outlook, Trello).
  - **Implementation**: Node.js with OAuth 2.0 clients (e.g., `googleapis`, `msal`).
  - **Features**: Pulls calendar events, pushes tasks, and tracks project-related activities.
- **AI Bridge**:
  - **Purpose**: Facilitates communication between Node.js and Python-based AI pipeline.
  - **Implementation**: `python-shell` for synchronous calls, REST API (FastAPI) for asynchronous model inference.
  - **Data Flow**: Sends preprocessed activity data to Python, receives AI outputs (e.g., predictions, insights).

### 2.2 Data Flow
1. **Collection**: Activity Tracker captures raw data every second, sending it to the Event Processor.
2. **Processing**: Event Processor batches data (every 10s), normalizes it, and applies initial categorization.
3. **Storage**: Processed data is stored in SQLite, with a copy sent to the AI Bridge.
4. **AI Processing**: AI Bridge forwards data to the Python pipeline, which runs neural network inference and returns results.
5. **Delivery**: API Server sends results to the frontend via REST/WebSocket, caching frequent queries in Redis.
6. **Syncing**: Integration Manager periodically syncs with external services, updating SQLite and triggering AI reprocessing if needed.

### 2.3 Technology Stack
- **Node.js**: v18.x, with Express.js (REST), `ws` (WebSocket), and `electron` for IPC.
- **SQLite**: Lightweight local database for activity logs and settings.
- **Redis**: Local instance for caching (e.g., analytics, AI outputs).
- **AWS (Optional)**: S3 for backups, DynamoDB for cross-device syncing, SageMaker for cloud training.
- **APIs**: Google Calendar API, Microsoft Graph API, Trello API, WebExtensions API.
- **Libraries**:
  - `async`: Queue-based event processing.
  - `jsonwebtoken`: JWT authentication.
  - `winston`: Logging for debugging.
  - `node-cron`: Scheduled tasks (e.g., daily reports).

### 2.4 Scalability and Performance
- **Local Optimization**:
  - Batch processing reduces CPU usage (10s batches).
  - SQLite indexing on `timestamp` and `category` for fast queries.
  - Redis caching for frequent endpoints (e.g., `/api/activities`, TTL: 1h).
- **Cloud Scaling (Optional)**:
  - AWS ECS for containerized API services if cloud sync is enabled.
  - DynamoDB auto-scaling for user data.
  - SageMaker endpoints for distributed model inference.
- **Latency Targets**:
  - Activity tracking: <100ms per event.
  - API response: <200ms for cached, <500ms for uncached.
  - AI inference: <1s for local, <2s for cloud.

### 2.5 Privacy and Security
- **Local-First**: All data stored in SQLite, encrypted with AES-256.
- **Data Minimization**: Only essential data (app titles, anonymized URLs) collected.
- **Encryption**: TLS for API/WebSocket, AES-256 for SQLite and Redis.
- **Differential Privacy**: Applied to aggregated data for cloud training.
- **User Controls**: Opt-out for URL tracking, data deletion via Settings.

  - Developers: 2 backend, 2 AI engineers ($200,000/year total).
  - Infrastructure: $5,000/year for CI/CD and monitoring.
- **Revenue Potential**:
  - 10,000 users at $9.99/month = $1.2M/year.
  - 5,000 one-time purchases at $99 = $495,000.
- **Timeline**:
  - Phase 1 (3 months): Core backend and tracking.
  - Phase 2 (3 months): Transformer and LSTM integration.
  - Phase 3 (4 months): GNN, CNN, GAN and integrations.
  - Phase 4 (2 months): Testing, optimization, release.

## 14. Conclusion
ProductivityPro’s backend and AI pipeline form a robust, privacy-focused system that powers advanced productivity features through a modular Node.js and Python architecture. The backend handles real-time activity tracking, data processing, and integrations with low latency, while the AI pipeline leverages five neural networks—Transformer, GNN, LSTM, CNN, and GAN—to deliver context-aware chat, workflow insights, predictive scheduling, pattern recognition, and scenario simulation. Detailed data structures, training workflows, and integration mechanisms ensure scalability and efficiency, with local-first storage and optional cloud support. This design provides a comprehensive blueprint for building a cutting-edge productivity app that surpasses Rize.io’s capabilities, ready for implementation by an engineering team.
