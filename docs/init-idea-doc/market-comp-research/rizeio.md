## 4. Funding
Rize.io has pursued a bootstrapped model following the founders’ previous venture, with no confirmed external funding for the current project. Below is a detailed analysis of its funding history and context:

### 4.1 Previous Venture
- **Humble Dot**: Will Goto and Macgill Davis previously co-founded Humble Dot, a venture-backed startup that raised **$3.1 million** from top Silicon Valley investors, including Susa Ventures. The company was valued above $12 million but shut down in 2020 due to a lack of product-market fit, returning just over a third of the investment to investors.[](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/bootstrapping-a-personal-productivity-saas-to-10k-mrr-cac5dfe318)
- **Impact on Rize.io**: The failure of Humble Dot informed Rize.io’s bootstrapped approach, focusing on rapid iteration and user feedback to achieve product-market fit without external pressure from venture capital.[](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/bootstrapping-a-personal-productivity-saas-to-10k-mrr-cac5dfe318)

### 4.2 Current Funding Status
- **Bootstrapped**: Rize.io is entirely bootstrapped, relying on revenue from subscriptions and user growth. By October 2021, Rize.io reported **$11,000+ in monthly recurring revenue (MRR)**, indicating strong early traction.[](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/hello-ih-i-cofounded-rize-where-we-got-1-on-product-hunt-in-may-and-just-reached-11-000-in-monthly-sales-ama-97f4c8f30e)
- **No External Funding**: Despite claims in some sources (e.g., getlatka.com stating Rize.io raised $11.4 million), these appear to refer to a different company (Rize, a fintech firm in Arlington, Virginia). No credible evidence suggests Rize.io (the productivity tracker) has raised external funds.[](https://getlatka.com/companies/rize.io)[](https://technical.ly/startups/rize-series-a-money-moves/)
- **Revenue Model**:
  - **Free Plan**: Retains one day of data, includes basic tracking, timer, goals view, desktop widget, focus metrics, focus music, distraction blocker, and break screen.[](https://rize.io/)
  - **Standard Plan**: $9.99/month, includes all Free Plan features, retains all tracking data, customizable categories, and daily/weekly reports.[](https://www.saasworthy.com/product/rize-io/pricing)
  - **Professional Plan**: $23.99/month, adds AI productivity insights and AI session planner.[](https://www.saasworthy.com/product/rize-io/pricing)
  - **Free Trial**: 7-day trial for paid plans, with the option to downgrade to the Free Plan.[](https://rize.io/)
- **Growth Metrics**: By February 2025, Rize.io reported **tens of thousands of daily active users**, reflecting significant user adoption.[](https://rize.io/)

### 4.3 Funding Misattributions
- **Rize (Fintech)**: A separate company, Rize, based in Arlington, Virginia, raised **$11.4 million** in a Series A round led by Walkabout Ventures on October 4, 2021. This fintech firm focuses on financial solutions for fintechs and brands, not productivity tracking.[](https://technical.ly/startups/rize-series-a-money-moves/)[](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rize)
- **Rize (Agtech)**: Another company, an agritech startup, raised **$14 million** in a Series A round in 2024, as reported by Business Insider and DealStreetAsia. This is unrelated to Rize.io.[](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rize-inc)
- **T-Rize Group**: A financial technology firm focusing on asset tokenization raised funds and launched a token ($RIZE) in May 2025, with a $2 billion pipeline and $23 million TVL. This is distinct from Rize.io.

### 4.4 Sustainability
- **Revenue-Driven Growth**: Rize.io’s bootstrapped model relies on subscription revenue, allowing the founders to maintain control and prioritize user-driven features.[](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/hello-ih-i-cofounded-rize-where-we-got-1-on-product-hunt-in-may-and-just-reached-11-000-in-monthly-sales-ama-97f4c8f30e)
- **Scalability Challenges**: The founders noted challenges in scaling user acquisition beyond initial growth tactics, indicating a focus on repeatable channels like content creators and referrals.[](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/hello-ih-i-cofounded-rize-where-we-got-1-on-product-hunt-in-may-and-just-reached-11-000-in-monthly-sales-ama-97f4c8f30e)

Its bootstrapped model, with $11,000+ MRR in 2021 and tens of thousands of daily active users by 2025, reflects strong market traction without external funding. While it meets most of your requirements—time tracking, categorization, analysis, and AI—it lacks dedicated scheduling features, mobile support, and an open-source model, unlike ActivityWatch. Its proprietary nature and focus on individual productivity make it a compelling alternative to open-source tools, with a user-friendly interface and strong security protocols. For users needing robust planning or team features, combining Rize.io with complementary tools may be necessary.
