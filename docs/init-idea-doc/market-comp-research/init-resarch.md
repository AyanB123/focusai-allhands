### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Productivity Tools

This section provides a comprehensive review of the tools considered to address your request for a desktop application that supports planning, scheduling, screen time tracking, categorization, analysis, and AI integration. The analysis is grounded in extensive research conducted on May 16, 2025, to ensure relevance and accuracy.

#### Understanding the Query
Your request, "Find me gothub for desktop planking and scheduleokg but also tracks screen use and categorize use and sites and analysis and has AI on or," suggests a need for a productivity tool with specific features. The terms "gothub," "desktop planking," and "scheduleokg" appear to be potential typos or unclear references, but the core requirements—screen time tracking, categorization, analysis, and AI—are clear. Given the context, "gothub" likely refers to a productivity tool, not the GitHub alternative (GotHub.io), as the latter does not align with the described features.

#### Research Methodology
To identify the right tool, I conducted web searches for desktop applications that meet your criteria, focusing on tools like RescueTime, ActivityWatch, Motion, and others. Each tool was evaluated for screen time tracking, categorization capabilities, analysis features, and AI integration. Additional page browses were performed to verify specific functionalities, ensuring a thorough comparison.

#### Detailed Tool Analysis
Below is a table summarizing the key features of the top contenders, followed by a deeper dive into each.

| Tool         | Screen Time Tracking | Categorize Use/Sites | Analysis | AI Features                     | Desktop Availability |
|--------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------|---------------------------------|----------------------|
| RescueTime   | Yes, automatic       | Yes, productive/distracting | Detailed reports, trends | RescueTime Assistant for habits | Windows, macOS, Linux |
| ActivityWatch| Yes, automatic       | Yes, by categories   | Productivity monitoring | None explicitly mentioned       | Windows, macOS, Linux, Android |
| Motion       | Implied, not explicit| Yes, tasks/projects  | AI Reports | AI Tasks, Calendar, Notetaker   | Windows, macOS        |
| Toggl Track  | Yes, via Timeline    | Limited categorization| Basic reports | Minimal AI, suggestions         | Windows              |

##### RescueTime: The Primary Recommendation
RescueTime, with over 2 million users and 3 billion hours logged, is a leading choice for automatic time tracking. It monitors screen time across websites and applications, categorizing them based on productivity levels (e.g., marking Reddit as "distracting" and Microsoft Word as "productive"). This aligns with your need to categorize use and sites. The tool provides detailed analysis through reports, trends, and personalized goals, supported by the RescueTime Assistant, which uses AI to build better habits and manage focus sessions. Its desktop availability for Windows, macOS, and Linux ensures it meets your platform needs. You can explore more at [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/).

##### ActivityWatch: A Strong Open-Source Alternative
ActivityWatch is an open-source, privacy-first time tracker that automatically logs active applications, window titles, and browser tabs via extensions for [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/activitywatch-web-watcher/nglaklhklhcoonedhgnpgddginnjdadi) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/aw-watcher-web/). It categorizes usage into categories like apps, games, and videos, and offers analysis for productivity monitoring and behavioral trends. However, it lacks explicit AI features, which may be a drawback given your emphasis on "has AI on or." It runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android, making it versatile, but its lack of AI integration makes it secondary to RescueTime.

##### Motion: AI-Powered but Limited in Tracking
Motion is an AI-powered super app for work, integrating tasks, calendar, meetings, docs, and notes. It uses AI for categorization (e.g., tasks, projects) and provides analysis through AI Reports, getting smarter daily with models from OpenAI and Anthropic. However, it does not explicitly mention screen time tracking or detailed site categorization, focusing more on project management. This makes it less aligned with your needs, despite its robust AI capabilities.

##### Other Considerations
Tools like Toggl Track and DeskTime were evaluated but found less comprehensive. Toggl Track offers Timeline for tracking websites and programs but has limited categorization and minimal AI. DeskTime, while good for employee monitoring, is more business-oriented and may not suit personal productivity needs. Other tools like Scheduleify and Reclaim.ai were considered for scheduling and AI, but they lack explicit screen time tracking and site categorization, making them less relevant.

#### Addressing "Desktop Planking and Scheduleokg"
The terms "desktop planking" and "scheduleokg" are unclear but likely refer to planning and scheduling features. RescueTime supports goal-setting and time management, which can assist with planning, while its categorization and analysis help with scheduling insights. Given the context, these features are covered, though not as explicitly as dedicated planning tools like Trevor AI or Reclaim.ai, which were considered but found lacking in screen time tracking.

#### Conclusion
After evaluating multiple tools, RescueTime emerges as the best fit, offering automatic screen time tracking, categorization of websites and applications, detailed analysis, and AI-powered habit-building. Its desktop availability and wide adoption make it a practical choice for your needs. For privacy-conscious users, ActivityWatch is a viable alternative, but its lack of AI may not fully meet your requirements.
