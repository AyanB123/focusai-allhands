## API Design Principles

ProductivityPro's APIs follow these design principles:

1. **RESTful**: APIs follow REST principles with resource-based URLs and standard HTTP methods
2. **Consistent**: Consistent naming, error handling, and response formats across all endpoints
3. **Versioned**: API versioning to ensure backward compatibility
4. **Secure**: OAuth 2.0 authentication and proper authorization checks
5. **Documented**: OpenAPI/Swagger specifications for all endpoints
