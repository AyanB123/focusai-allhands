# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Architecture

## Overview

The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a specialized deep learning architecture used in ProductivityPro to analyze activity patterns as visual data. By transforming time-series activity data into 2D representations, the CNN can identify spatial patterns and recurring behaviors that might not be apparent through traditional time-series analysis.

## Purpose

The CNN serves several critical functions within ProductivityPro:

1. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify visual patterns in activity heatmaps
2. **Category Classification**: Classify activities into productivity categories
3. **Feature Extraction**: Extract meaningful features from raw activity data
4. **Heatmap Analysis**: Power the pattern heatmaps in the Analytics dashboard

## Architecture

### Input Structure

The CNN processes activity data transformed into 2D representations:

- **Activity Heatmaps**: 2D matrices where:
  - X-axis: Time of day (24 hours, 15-minute intervals)
  - Y-axis: Days (7 days for weekly patterns, 30/31 for monthly)
  - Values: Activity intensity or productivity scores
  
- **Multi-channel Input**:
  - Channel 1: Productivity scores
  - Channel 2: Application category distribution
  - Channel 3: Activity duration

### Model Architecture

The CNN implementation uses a modern architecture with residual connections:

1. **Input Layer**: Takes multi-channel activity heatmaps
2. **Convolutional Blocks**:
   - 4 convolutional blocks with increasing filter counts (32, 64, 128, 256)
   - Each block contains:
     - 3x3 convolution
     - Batch normalization
     - ReLU activation
     - Residual connection
     - 2x2 max pooling
3. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Global average pooling
   - Dropout (0.3)
4. **Output Layers**:
   - Pattern classification: Identifies common productivity patterns
   - Feature maps: Highlights important regions in heatmaps

```python
class ProductivityCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, num_classes):
        super(ProductivityCNN, self).__init__()
        
        # First convolutional block
        self.conv1 = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv2d(in_channels, 32, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
            nn.BatchNorm2d(32),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.MaxPool2d(2)
        )
        
        # Residual blocks
        self.res_block1 = ResidualBlock(32, 64)
        self.res_block2 = ResidualBlock(64, 128)
        self.res_block3 = ResidualBlock(128, 256)
        
        # Global average pooling
        self.gap = nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d(1)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.3)
        
        # Output layers
        self.pattern_classifier = nn.Linear(256, num_classes)
        
        # Feature map projection
        self.feature_projection = nn.Conv2d(256, 1, kernel_size=1)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        # Convolutional feature extraction
        x = self.conv1(x)
        x = self.res_block1(x)
        x = self.res_block2(x)
        features = self.res_block3(x)
        
        # Pattern classification
        gap_features = self.gap(features).view(features.size(0), -1)
        gap_features = self.dropout(gap_features)
        pattern_output = self.pattern_classifier(gap_features)
        
        # Feature map for visualization
        feature_maps = self.feature_projection(features)
        
        return pattern_output, feature_maps, features


class ResidualBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels):
        super(ResidualBlock, self).__init__()
        
        self.conv_block = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
            nn.BatchNorm2d(out_channels),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Conv2d(out_channels, out_channels, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
            nn.BatchNorm2d(out_channels)
        )
        
        self.downsample = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size=1),
            nn.BatchNorm2d(out_channels)
        )
        
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.maxpool = nn.MaxPool2d(2)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        identity = self.downsample(x)
        out = self.conv_block(x)
        out += identity
        out = self.relu(out)
        out = self.maxpool(out)
        return out
```

## Training Process

The CNN is trained using a combination of supervised and self-supervised learning:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Activity logs transformed into heatmap representations
   - User-provided productivity ratings
   - Pre-labeled pattern categories

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Conversion of time-series data to 2D heatmaps
   - Normalization of values
   - Data augmentation (time shifting, noise addition)
   - Channel creation (productivity, category, duration)

3. **Training Objectives**:
   - Pattern classification: Cross-entropy loss
   - Self-supervised contrastive learning for feature extraction
   - Attention map supervision for interpretability

4. **Training Strategy**:
   - Pre-training on anonymized user data
   - Fine-tuning on individual user data
   - Transfer learning from general activity recognition
   - Continuous learning with new user data (opt-in)

5. **Hyperparameters**:
   - Learning rate: 0.0005 with cosine annealing
   - Batch size: 32
   - Epochs: 50
   - Weight decay: 1e-4

## Integration with Other Components

The CNN interacts with several other components of ProductivityPro:

1. **Activity Tracker**: Provides raw activity data for heatmap creation
2. **LSTM Model**: Shares pattern insights for comprehensive analysis
3. **GNN Model**: Provides complementary graph-based patterns
4. **Analytics Dashboard**: Powers heatmap visualizations and pattern highlights
5. **Transformer Model**: Combines CNN insights with natural language for chat responses

## Performance Considerations

To ensure optimal performance on desktop hardware:

1. **Model Optimization**:
   - Quantization to reduce model size
   - Pruning to remove unnecessary filters
   - Knowledge distillation for smaller models

2. **Inference Efficiency**:
   - Incremental updates to heatmaps
   - Caching of intermediate feature maps
   - Background processing during idle time

3. **Metrics**:
   - Inference time: <100ms for typical heatmaps
   - Model size: <20MB
   - Memory usage: <100MB during inference

## Privacy and Security

The CNN implementation includes several privacy-preserving features:

1. **Local Processing**: All pattern analysis happens on the user's device
2. **Anonymization**: Any shared data for training is anonymized
3. **Differential Privacy**: Added noise to protect sensitive patterns
4. **Opt-in Training**: Users control whether their data improves the model

## Applications in ProductivityPro

The CNN model enables several key features:

1. **Pattern Heatmaps**: Visualizing activity patterns by time of day and day of week
2. **Pattern Classification**: Identifying common productivity patterns (e.g., "Morning focus", "Afternoon slump")
3. **Attention Maps**: Highlighting important regions in activity visualizations
4. **Category Recognition**: Automatically categorizing activities based on patterns
5. **Anomaly Highlighting**: Identifying unusual deviations in activity patterns

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements for the CNN component:

1. **3D CNN**: Extend to 3D convolutions for analyzing patterns across weeks/months
2. **Multi-resolution CNN**: Analyze patterns at different time scales simultaneously
3. **Explainable CNN**: Improve interpretability of pattern recognition
4. **Federated Learning**: Enable privacy-preserving learning across users
5. **Multimodal Fusion**: Combine with other data sources (calendar, location)
