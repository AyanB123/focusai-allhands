# AI/ML Architecture

ProductivityPro integrates five neural network models to provide advanced AI capabilities for productivity tracking, analysis, and optimization. This section provides detailed documentation on each model's architecture, training process, and integration.

## Neural Network Models

1. [Transformer](transformer.md): Context-aware chat assistant
2. [Graph Neural Network (GNN)](gnn.md): Workflow relationship analysis
3. [Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)](lstm.md): Predictive scheduling
4. [Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)](cnn.md): Activity pattern recognition
5. [Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)](gan.md): Scenario simulation

## AI/ML Pipeline

The AI/ML pipeline in ProductivityPro consists of the following components:

1. **Data Collection**: Activity data captured by the Activity Tracker
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Normalization, categorization, and feature extraction
3. **Model Training**: Initial training and continuous fine-tuning
4. **Inference**: Real-time predictions and insights
5. **Feedback Loop**: User feedback for model improvement

## Integration Architecture

The AI/ML components are integrated with the rest of the application through:

1. **AI Bridge**: Node.js-Python communication layer
2. **FastAPI Server**: REST API for model inference
3. **WebSocket**: Real-time updates for AI insights
4. **Model Storage**: Local storage for model weights

## Privacy and Security

The AI/ML architecture is designed with privacy and security in mind:

1. **Local-First**: Models run locally on the user's device
2. **Differential Privacy**: Training with privacy-preserving techniques
3. **Federated Learning**: Optional collaborative learning without sharing raw data
4. **Encryption**: Model weights and sensitive data are encrypted

## Performance Optimization

To ensure efficient operation on consumer hardware:

1. **Model Quantization**: 8-bit integer quantization for faster inference
2. **Mixed Precision**: FP16 for training, INT8 for inference
3. **Lazy Loading**: Models loaded only when needed
4. **GPU Acceleration**: Optional CUDA support for NVIDIA GPUs
